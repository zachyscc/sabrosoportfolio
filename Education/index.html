				<p>
					My educational journey has been a diverse and enriching one, marked by transitions and growth. It began at Gate of Heaven Academy Nursery and Kinder Preparatory, where I first embarked on my educational path. During my grade school years, I experienced a variety of learning environments, starting with Holy Angel for Grades 1 and 2 and then moving to Gate of Heaven Academy for Grades 3 and 4. For Grades 5 and 6, I continued my studies at Urduja Elementary School. My high school years were spent at St Clare College of Caloocan, covering both 1st year and 4th year. In my senior high school, I explored different academic paths through the General Academic Strand (G.A.S) and the Home Economics Strand at the same institution. Now, I find myself in the exciting phase of college life, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at St Clare College of Caloocan, where I am eager to further expand my knowledge and skills in the world of technology and computer science.
